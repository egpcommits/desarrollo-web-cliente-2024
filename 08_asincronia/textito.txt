Hey, boy, I'ma get ya
I'ma get you real good and I bet ya
Hey, boy, once I get ya
You'll be, oh, so glad that I met ya
Ow (TWICE)
Step one, do my highlight
Make me shine so bright in the moonlight
Step two, silhouette tight
Baby, even my shadow looks good, right?
Step three, when I arrive
Make you look my way with your heart eyes
Step four, got you on the floor
Make you say, "More, more, more"
When I say, "Hi"
I'm feeling all your attention on me
Hi
No reason to be so shy with me
I ain't gonna bite, come on over (No)
I know you wanna move a little closer (Yeah)
I got a plan to get you with me
I got you on my radar, soon you're gonna be with me
My strategy, strategy will get ya, get ya, baby
Winning is my trademark, soon you'll never wanna leave
My strategy, strategy will get ya, get ya, baby
Hey, boy, I'ma get ya
I'ma get you real good and I bet ya
Hey, boy, once I get ya
You'll be, oh, so glad that I met ya
When your cheeks go red (That's cute)
I wanna dance, you said ("Oh, cool")
'Til I'm in your head (It's cruel)
And you can't forget
You're feeling things now, and you're confused
Watching my body getting loose
You don't know what you're gonna do
You're mine
When I say, "Hi"
I'm feeling all your attention on me
Hi
No reason to be so shy with me
I ain't gonna bite, come on over (No)
I know you wanna move a little closer (Yeah)
I got a plan to get you with me
I got you on my radar, soon you're gonna be with me
My strategy, strategy will get ya, get ya, baby
Winning is my trademark, soon you'll never wanna leave
My strategy, strategy will get ya, get ya, baby
My strategy, strategy
Like gravity, gravity
One look at me, look at me
I bet ya, bet ya, bet ya, boy
You'll be down on your knees
Calling me up, begging me, don't leave
My strategy, strategy
Will get ya, get ya, get ya, boy (Ah-oh!)
Hey, boy, I'ma get ya
I'ma get you real good and I bet ya (Real good and I bet ya)
Hey, boy, once I get ya
You'll be, oh, so glad that I met ya (Oh, so glad that I, ooh)
Hey, boy, I'ma get ya (Hey, boy, yeah)
I'ma get you real good and I bet ya (Good and I bet ya)
Hey, boy, once I get ya (Hey, boy)
You'll be, oh, so glad that I met ya (Oh, so glad that I met ya)
Hey, boy, I'ma get ya
I'ma get you real good and I bet ya
